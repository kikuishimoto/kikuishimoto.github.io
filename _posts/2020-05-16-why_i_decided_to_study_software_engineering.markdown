I grew up in a very math/science-driven household. My dad was a full-time math teacher and a part-time computer nerd. We would gather around the TV every night to watch "How the Universe Works' (Michio Kaku is still a physics GOD to me) and then have intense discussions on everything theoretical physics. Physics became my first love, and I was dead set on becoming a physicist until I took my first coding class during my freshman year of college. 

Have you ever tried something and immediately felt like it was something you were made to do? Have you ever had one of those "yup, this is what I want" moments? That is what I felt after my first week of coding. It made me feel so accomplished and proud of myself. It was the thing I knew I needed to do.

Personal satisfaction isn't the only reason to start studying Software engineering, though. 

Software Engineering offers you one thing a lot of jobs do not provide. It offers Job Security. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, software engineering has an impressive 24% growth rate. With the national average being 7%, that means the software engineering field is growing more than 3x faster than average. The fear of never getting a job is basically non-existent in a world that is becoming more reliant on software.

As an avid puzzles solver, software engineering just makes sense for me. In the grand scheme of things, software engineers are just solving one big puzzle. Sometimes you spend hours trying to debug code. Sometimes you hung up on writing tests. But the pride you feel after you have done hours of debugging makes you feel invincible.

Another reason is that I can code my own applications and websites. I want to encrypt the next million-dollar app? Does my best friend need a website so she can start selling her own jewelry? Or do I want to code a stupid game because I am bored? Imagine just being able to sit down and *create* the dang thing. That is what I am trying to achieve.

Now I saved the best reason for last, and that reason is pay/benefits. According to Glassdoor, software engineers make 103k per year with an average starting salary of 86k per year! Most jobs come with health care, paid time off, dental/eye care, matching 401k contributions, free travel, and the opportunity for remote work! It's so hard to find a job with those benefits for that salary.

I felt like it would be a fantastic way to start my adult life between all of the perks of becoming a software engineer. It's filled with opportunity, community, and creativity. This is my dream career, and I am so excited to make a difference while doing it.
