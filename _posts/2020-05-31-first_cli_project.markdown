Here is it, my first CLI project and my first time scraping without help. Overall, I found this difficult. I dealt with a lot of self doubt along the way but it was SO worth it once I finally completed it. Creating something from nothing was a magical experience and I definitely learned a lot about it.

**About the app:**
****
I made an app called Find Pup. This app scrapes a dog website then turns those god into objects. You can select a dog, and the app will print out a description of it. 

**The process**
I procrastinated a lot at the beginning. I felt like I didn't even know where to start. I dealt with a lot of self-doubts. I ended up reaching out to some of my classmates, and they felt the same way I did. It helped me not feel alone in this.

I ended watching some videos Flatiron recommended to me so I could at least get my foot in the door.

Eventually, I ended up writing my Command Line Interface. I started by writing the code I wanted with the variables I wanted. Then I defined those variables in the Dog and Scrapper class while degging frequently. I ended up making about a million mistakes, but that means I learned a million lessons. 

Out of all the millions of mistakes I made, my biggest one doubted myself. You are only as great as you think you are. You are only as smart as you think you are. You are only as talented as you think you are. It's no secret that confidence can push you far. What many people don't think about is how negative self-talk can slow you down. There were times during this project where I just wanted to cry at the idea of failing. I was so fixated on how I wasn't talented enough to complete this project. But that's not true. We are all skilled enough to complete these projects; we have to believe in ourselves and not engage in negative self-talk.
Don't be your own biggest hurdle.
